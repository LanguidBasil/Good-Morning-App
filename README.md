# Good-Morning-App

### Problem
I noticed that everyday I wake up and open a lot of sites:  
2 mail boxes, my university site, vk, trello board, and so on.  
Everyday these sites are the same. *I decided to automate this*

### How it works
You enter websites you want to open. You can save this list to .json and on starting  
app your changes will be saved. On clicking `Run` button, you guessed it, all sites  
will open at once (there is also `auto-close` toggle near that button)  

It was meant to be on startup. Imagine it, you wake up, boot up your pc and  
on clicking one button your -open-6-sites- routine is done

If you don't want to change source code - **you can just download .rar file**  
It contains .exe file so you can easily start using this app
