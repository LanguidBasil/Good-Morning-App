# Good-Morning-App

I found out that everyday I wake up and open same 4 sites: 2 mail
boxes, my university site, vk. I decided to automate this

This app takes in websites, and then compiles it to one .py file in same directory.
When you run this file it will open these websites in default browse

It was writen 100% in python with tkinter framework for GUI
